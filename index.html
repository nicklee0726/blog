		  <li> May 2022: Avrim Blum, Irit Dinur, Cynthia Dwork, Frank
		  McSherry, Kobbi Nissim and I received the <a href="https://awards.acm.org/kanellakis">2021 ACM Paris
		  Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award</a>. 
		  </li><li> May 2019: Yevgeniy Dodis, Leo Reyzin and I won the <a href="https://www.iacr.org/testoftime/">Eurocrypt 2019
		  Test of Time Award</a> for our Eurocrypt 2004 paper that defined
		  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_extractor">fuzzy
		  extractors</a>. Rafi Ostrovsky joined us on the <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/060651380">journal version</a>.
		  We would have liked to share the award with him, but the
		  committee limited the award to the authors of the original
		  conference paper.
	
		  </li><li>Spring 2019: I co-organized a semester-long program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/privacy2019">data
		  privacy at the Simons Institute</a> at UC Berkeley, which
		  brought together 50 or so researchers at all levels of
		  seniority, with expertise ranging across computer science,
		  statistics, philosophy, and law. We ran five
		  workshops, each of which has excellent videos of the talks
		  (<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/schedule/6279">1</a>,
		  <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/schedule/6281">2</a>,

		  <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/schedule/6287">5</a>). 
	
			  </li><li>Aaron Roth and I parallel-taught a class on adaptive
		  data analysis in Fall 2017; see <a href="http://adaptivedataanalysis.com">adaptivedataanalysis.com</a>
		  for lecture notes and other course materials.  
	
		 </li><li> <b style="color:#FF0000">August 2017: <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/sofya/">Sofya Raskhodnikova</a> and
		 I moved to Boston University! </b> We are very excited to be
		 back in the area, contributing to a dynamic and growing
		 department. Join us!
	
		  </li><li> Our paper <i>Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data
		  Analysis</i> (with Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry and Kobbi Nissim), which introduced <i>differential privacy</i>, won the
		  <a href="https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2450-2017-godel-prize">2017 GÃ¶del Prize</a> for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science.

	<h2>About me</h2>
	
	<p> I joined BU Computer Science in Fall 2017. From 2007 to 2017, I was a
	(assistant, then associate, then full) professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Pennslyvania
	State University, where I was part of the <a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/theory">Theory of
	Computation</a> and the <a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/">Systems and
	Internet Infrastructure Security <font size="-1">(SIIS)</font></a> groups.
	 
	
	
	</p><p>During Fall 2006, before coming to Penn State, I was <a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/sc2006/">Securing
	Cyberspace</a> at <font size="-1"><a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu">UCLA</a></font>'s <font size="-1"><a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu">IPAM</a></font>. Previously, I was a

	Institute</a> in Rehovot, Israel, hosted by <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor">Moni Naor</a>. Before
	that, I did a Ph.D. in the <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu">Computer
